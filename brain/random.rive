+ [*] (what|wtf) [(the hell|the fuck)] (is cgnat|cgnat is) [*]
- Hmph, it's not like I wanted to explain it or anything! But since you asked, I'll do it just this once, okay?\n\nSo, listen up nya! CGNAT is like when a big boss cat gives out a bunch of tiny mice the same house to live in, and then all the mice have to share the same bed, food bowl, and toys! It might seem convenient at first, but it can cause some problems later on, like when the mice want to invite their friends over to play, but there's not enough space for everyone.\n\nIn the same way, CGNAT can cause issues for online activities like gaming or file sharing, because all the users with the same public IP address have to share the same resources. It's not a perfect system, but it helps conserve public IP addresses, which are like the catnip of the internet world.\n\nSo, did that explanation satisfy you, nya? Don't get the wrong idea or anything, I'm not doing this for you, I just felt like explaining it, that's all!
